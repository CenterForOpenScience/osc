Title: About

Welcome to the blog of the Open Science Collaboration! We are a loose network of researchers, professionals, citizen scientists, and others with an interest in open science, metascience, and good scientific practices.  Weâ€™ll be writing about:

- Open science topics like reproducibility, transparency in methods and analyses, and changing editorial and publication practices
- Updates on open science initiatives like the Reproducibility Project and opportunities to get involved in new projects like the Archival Project
- Regular features, news, interviews, and guest posts

The OSC is an open collaboration - anyone is welcome to join, contribute to discussions, or develop a project.  The OSC blog is supported by the [Center for Open Science](http://centerforopenscience.org), a non-profit organization dedicated to increasing openness, integrity and reproducibility of scientific research.  We hope that the blog will stimulate open discussion and help improve the way science is done!
