<p>An Open Science Collaboration -- made up of Uri Simonsohn, Etienne LeBel, Don Moore, Leif D. Nelson, Brian Nosek, and Joe Simmons -- is glad to announce a new initiative aiming to improve community norms toward the disclosure of basic methodological information during the peer-review process. Endorsed by the Center for Open Science, the initiative involves a standard reviewer statement that any peer reviewer can include in their review requesting that authors add a statement to the paper confirming that they have disclosed all data exclusions, experimental conditions, assessed measures, and how they determined their samples sizes (following from the 21-word solution; Simmons, Nelson, &amp; Simonsohn, 2012, 2013; see also <a href="http://psychdisclosure.org/">PsychDisclosure.org</a>; LeBel et al., 2013). Here is the statement, which is <a href="http://osf.io/project/hadz3">available on the Open Science Framework</a>:</p>
<p><em>"I request that the authors add a statement to the paper confirming whether, for all experiments, they have reported all measures, conditions, data exclusions, and how they determined their sample sizes. The authors should, of course, add any additional text to ensure the statement is accurate. This is the standard reviewer disclosure request endorsed by the Center for Open Science (<a href="http://osf.io/project/hadz3">see http://osf.io/project/hadz3</a>). I include it in every review."</em></p>
<p>The idea originated from the realization that as peer reviewers, we typically lack fundamental information regarding how the data was collected and analyzed which prevents us from be able to properly evaluate the claims made in a submitted manuscript. Some reviewers interested in requesting such information, however, were concerned that such requests would make them appear selective and/or compromise their anonymity. Discussions ensued and contributors developed a standard reviewer disclosure request statement that overcomes these concerns and allows the community of reviewers to improve community norms toward the disclosure of such methodological information across all journals and articles.</p>
<p>Some of the contributors, including myself, were hoping for a reviewer statement with a bit more teeth. For instance, requesting the disclosure of such information as a requirement before accepting to review an article or requiring the re-review of a revised manuscript once the requested information has been disclosed. The team of contributors, however, ultimately decided that it would be better to start small to get acceptance, in order to maximize the probability that the initiative has an impact in shaping the community norms.</p>
<p>Hence, next time you are invited to review a manuscript for publication at any journal, please remember to include the reviewer disclosure statement!</p>

<p>In 1959, Festinger and Carlsmith reported the results of an experiment that spawned a voluminous body of research on cognitive dissonance. In that experiment, all subjects performed a boring task. Some participants were paid $1 or $20 to tell the next subject the task was interesting and fun whereas participants in a control condition did no such thing. All participants then indicated how enjoyable they felt the task was, their desire to participate in another similar experiment, and the scientific importance of the experiment. The authors hypothesized that participants paid $1 to tell the next participant that the boring task they just completed was interesting would experience internal dissonance, which could be reduced by altering their attitudes on the three outcomes measures. A little known fact about the results of this experiment, however, is that only on <em>one</em> of these outcome measures did a statistically significant effect emerge across conditions. The authors reported that subjects paid $1 enjoyed the task more than those paid $20 (or the control participants), but no statistically significant differences emerged on the other two measures. </p>
<p>In another highly influential paper, Word, Zanna, and Cooper (1974) documented the self-fulfilling prophecies of racial stereotypes. The researchers had white subjects interview trained white and black applicants and coded for six non-verbal behaviors of immediacy (distance, forward lean, eye contact, shoulder orientation, interview length, and speech error rate). They found that that white interviewers treated black applicants with lower levels of non-verbal immediacy than white applicants. In a follow-up study involving white subjects only, applicants treated with less immediate non-verbal behaviors were judged to perform less well during the interview than applicants treated with more immediate non-verbal behaviors. A fascinating result, however, a little known fact about this paper is that only three of the six measures of non-verbal behaviors assessed in the first study (and subsequently used in the second study) were statistically significant. </p>
<p>What do these two examples make salient in relation to how psychologists report their results nowadays? Regular readers of prominent journals like <em>Psychological Science</em> and <em>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</em> may see what I’m getting at: It is very rare these days to see articles in these journals wherein half or most of the reported dependent variables (DVs) fail to show statistically significant effects. Rather, one typically sees squeaky-clean looking articles where all of the DVs show statistically significant effects across all of the studies, with an occasional mention of a DV achieving “marginal significance” (Giner-Sorolla, 2012).</p>
<p>In this post, I want us to consider the possibility that psychologists’ reporting practices may have changed in the past 50 years. This then raises the question as to how this came about. One possibility is that as incentives became increasingly more perverse in psychology (Nosek,Spies, &amp; Motyl, 2012), some researchers realized that they could out-compete their peers by reporting “cleaner” looking results which would appear more compelling to editors and reviewers (Giner-Sorolla, 2012). For example, decisions were made to simply not report DVs that failed to show significant differences across conditions or that only achieved “marginal significance”. Indeed, nowadays sometimes even editors or reviewers will demand that such DVs not be reported (see <a href="http://PsychDisclosure.org">PsychDisclosure.org</a>; LeBel et al., 2013). A similar logic may also have contributed to researchers’ deciding not to fully report independent variables that failed to yield statistically significant effects and not fully reporting the exclusion of outlying participants due to fear that this information may raise doubts among the editor/reviewers and hurt their chance of getting their foot in the door (i.e., at least getting a revise-and-resubmit).</p>
<p>An alternative explanation is that new tools and technology have given us the ability to measure a greater number of DVs, which makes it more difficult to report on all them. For example, neuroscience (e.g., EEG, fMRI) and eye-tracking methods yield multitudes of analyzable data that were not previously available. Though this is undeniably true, the internet and online article supplements gives us the ability to fully report our methods and results and use the article to draw attention to the most interesting data.</p>
<p>Considering the possibility that psychologists’ reporting practices have changed in the past 50 years has implications for how to construe recent calls for the need to raise reporting standards in psychology (LeBel et al., 2013; Simmons, Nelson, &amp; Simonsohn, 2011; Simmons, Nelson, &amp; Simonsohn, 2012). Rather than seeing these calls as rigid new requirements that might interfere with exploratory research and stifle our science, one could construe such calls as a plea to revert back to the fuller reporting of results that used to be the norm in our science. From this perspective, it should not be viewed as overly onerous or authoritarian to ask researchers to disclose all excluded observations, all tested experimental conditions, all analyzed measures, and their data collection termination rule (what I’m now calling the BASIC 4 methodological categories covered by PsychDisclosure.org and Simmons et al.’s, 2012 21-word solution). It would simply be the way our forefathers used to do it.</p>
