“Improving (Our) Science” at the University of Virginia. The class
reviewed evidence suggesting that scientific practices are not operating
ideally and are damaging the reproducibility of publishing findings. For
example, the power of an experimental design in null hypothesis
significance testing is a function of the effect size being investigated
and the size the sample to test it—power is greater when effects are
larger and samples are bigger. In the authors’ field of psychology, for
example, estimates suggest that the power of published studies to detect
an average effect size is .50 or less (Cohen, 1962; Gigerenzer &amp;
Sedlmeier, 1989). Assuming that all of the published effects are true,
approximately 50% of published studies would reveal positive results
(i.e., <em>p</em> &lt; .05 supporting the hypothesis). In reality, more than 90%
of published results are positive (Sterling, 1959; <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0010068">Fanelli,
2010</a>).</p>
<p>How is it possible that the average study has power to detect the
average true effect 50% of the time or less and yet does so about 90% of
the time? It isn’t. Then how does this occur? One obvious contributor is
selective reporting. Positive effects are more likely than negative
effects to be submitted and accepted for publication (Greenwald, 1975).
The consequences include [1] the published literature is more likely to
exaggerate the size of true effects because with low powered designs
researchers must still leverage chance to obtain a large enough effect
size to produce a positive result; and [2] the proportion of false
positives – there isn’t actually an effect to detect – will be inflated
beyond the nominal alpha level of 5% (Ioannidis, 2005).</p>
<p>The class discussed this and other scientific practices that may
interfere with knowledge accumulation. Some of the relatively common
ones are described in Table 1 along with some solutions that we, and
others, identified. Problem. Solution. Easy. The class just fixed
science. Now, class members can adopt the solutions as best available
practices. Our scientific outputs will be more accurate, and significant
effects will be more reproducible. Our science will be better.</p>
<p>Alex Schiller, a class member and graduate student, demurred. He agreed
that the new practices would make science better, but disagreed that we
should do them all. A better solution, he argued, is to take small
steps: adopt one solution, wait for that to become standard scientific
practice, and then adopt another solution.</p>
<p>We know that some of our practices are deficient, we know how to improve
them, but Alex is arguing that we shouldn’t implement all the solutions?
Alex’s lapse of judgment can be forgiven—he’s just a graduate student.
However, his point isn’t a lapse. Faced with the reality of succeeding
as a scientist, Alex is right.</p>

<h2>The Context</h2>
<p>In an ideal world, scientists use the best available practices to
produce accurate, reproducible science. But, scientists don’t live in an
ideal world. Alex is creating a career for himself. To succeed, he must
publish. Papers are academic currency. They are Alex’s ticket to job
security, fame, and fortune. Well, okay, maybe just job security. But,
not everything is published, and some publications are valued more than
others. Alex can maximize his publishing success by producing particular
kinds of results. Positive effects, not negative effects (<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0010068">Fanelli,
2010</a>;
Sterling, 1959). Novel effects, not verifications of prior effects (<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1745691612462588">Open
Science Collaboration, 2012</a>). Aesthetically appealing, clean results,
not results with ambiguities or inconsistencies (Giner-Sorolla, 2012).
Just look in the pages of <em>Nature</em>, or any other leading journal, they
are filled with articles producing positive, novel, beautiful results.
They are wonderful, exciting, and groundbreaking. Who wouldn’t want
that?</p>
<p>We do want that, and science advances in leaps with groundbreaking
results. The hard reality is that few results are actually
groundbreaking. And, even for important research, the results are often
far from beautiful. There are confusing contradictions, apparent
exceptions, and things that just don’t make sense. To those in the
laboratory, this is no surprise. Being at the frontiers of knowledge is
hard. We don’t quite know what we are looking at. That’s why we are
studying it. Or, as Einstein said, “If we knew what we were doing, it
wouldn’t be called research”.
 
But, those outside the laboratory get a different impression. When the
research becomes a published article, much of the muck goes away. The
published articles are like the pictures of this commentary’s authors at
the top of this page. Those pictures are about as good as we can look.
You should see the discards. Those with insider access know, for
example, that we each own three shirts with buttons and have highly
variable shaving habits. Published articles present the best-dressed,
clean-shaven versions of the actual work.</p>
<p>Just as with people, when you replicate effects yourself to see them in
person, they may not be as beautiful as they appeared in print. The
published version often looks much better than reality. The effect is
hard to get, dependent on a multitude of unmentioned limiting
conditions, or entirely irreproducible (Begley &amp; Ellis, 2012; Prinz et
al., 2011).</p>
<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>It is not surprising that effects are presented in their best light.
Career advancement depends on publishing success. More beautiful looking
results are easier to publish and more likely to earn rewards
(Giner-Sorolla, 2012). Individual incentives align for maximizing
publishability, even at the expense of accuracy (<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1745691612459058">Nosek et al.,
2012</a>).</p>
<p>Consider three hypothetical papers shown in Table 2. For all three, the
researchers identified an important problem and had an idea for a novel
solution. <em>Paper A</em> is a natural beauty. Two well planned studies showed
effects supporting the idea. <em>Paper B</em> and <em>Paper C</em> were conducted with
identical study designs. <em>Paper B</em> is natural, but not beautiful; <em>Paper
C</em> is a manufactured beauty. Both <em>Paper B</em> and <em>Paper C</em> were based on 3
studies. One study for each showed clear support for the idea. A second
study was a mixed success for <em>Paper B</em>, but “worked” for <em>Paper C</em> after
increasing the sample size a bit and analyzing the data a few different
ways. A third study did not work for either. <em>Paper B</em> reported the
failure with an explanation for why the methodology might be to blame,
rather than the idea being incorrect. The authors of <em>Paper C</em> generated
the same methodological explanation, categorized the study as a pilot,
and did not report it at all. Also, <em>Paper C</em> described the final sample
sizes and analysis strategies, but did not mention that extra data was
collected after initial analysis, or that alternative analysis
strategies had been tried and dismissed.</p>

<p><em>Paper A</em> is clearly better than <em>Paper B</em>. <em>Paper A</em> should be
published in a more prestigious outlet and generate more attention and
accolade. <em>Paper C</em> <strong>looks</strong> like <em>Paper A</em>, but in reality it <strong>is</strong>
like <em>Paper B</em>. The actual evidence is more circumspect than the
apparent evidence. Based on the report, however, no one can tell the
difference between <em>Paper A</em> and <em>Paper C</em>.</p>
<p>Two possibilities would minimize the negative impact of publishing
manufactured beauties like <em>Paper C</em>. First, if replication were
standard practice, then manufactured effects would be identified
rapidly. However, direct replication is very uncommon (<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1745691612462588">Open Science
Collaboration, 2012</a>). Once an effect is the literature, there is little
systematic ethic to self-correct. Rather than be weeded out, false
effects persist or just slowly fade away. Second, scientists could just
avoid doing the practices that lead to <em>Paper C</em> making this
illustration an irrelevant hypothetical. Unfortunately, a growing body
of evidence suggests that these practices occur, and some are even
common (e.g., <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0956797611430953">John et al., 2012</a>).</p>
<p>To avoid the practices that produce <em>Paper C</em>, the scientist must be
aware of and confront a conflict-of-interest—what is best for science
versus what is best for me. Scientists have inordinate opportunity to
pursue flexible decision-making in design and analysis, and there is
minimal accountability for those practices. Further, humans’ prodigious
motivated reasoning capacities provide a way to decide that the outcomes
that look best for us also has the most compelling rationale (<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0033-2909.108.3.480">Kunda,
1990</a>). So, we may convince ourselves that the best course of action for
us was the best course of action period. It is very difficult to stop
doing suspect practices when we have thoroughly convinced ourselves that
we are not doing them.</p>
<h2>The Solution</h2>
<p>Alex needs to publish to succeed. The practices in Table 1 are to the
scientist, what steroids are to the athlete. They amplify the likelihood
of success in a competitive marketplace. If others are using, and Alex
decides to rely on his natural performance, then he will disadvantage
his career prospects. Alex wants to do the best science he can <em>and</em> be
successful for doing it. In short, he is the same as every other
scientist we know, ourselves included. Alex shouldn’t have to make a
choice between doing the best science and being successful—these should
be the same thing.</p>
<p>Is Alex stuck? Must he wait for institutional regulation, audits, and
the science police to fix the system? In a regulatory world, practices
are enforced and he need not worry that he’s committing career suicide
by following them. Many scientists are wary of a strong regulatory
environment in science, particularly for the possibility of stifling
innovation. Some of the best ideas start with barely any evidence at
all, and restrictive regulations on confidence in outputs could
discourage taking risks on new ideas. Nonetheless, funders, governments,
and other stakeholders are taking notice of the problematic incentive
structures in science. If we don’t solve the problem ourselves,
regulators may solve them for us.</p>
<p>Luckily, Alex has an alternative. The practices in Table 1 may be
widespread, but the solutions are also well known and endorsed as good
practice (<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1745691612459521">Fuchs et al., 2012</a>). That is, scientists easily understand the
differences between Papers A, B, and C – if they have full access to how
the findings were produced. As a consequence, the only way to be
rewarded for natural achievements over manufactured ones is to make the
process of obtaining the results transparent. Using the best available
practices privately will improve science but hurt careers. Using the
best available practices publicly will improve science while
simultaneously improving the reputation of the scientist. With openness,
success can be influenced by the results <em>and</em> by how they were
obtained.
 </p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The present incentives for publishing are focused on the one thing that
we scientists are absolutely, positively not supposed to control - the
results of the investigation. Scientists have complete control over the
design, procedures, and execution of the study. The results are what
they are.</p>
<p>A better science will emerge when the incentives for achievement align
with the things that scientists can (and should) control with their
wits, effort, and creativity. With results, beauty is contingent on what
is known about their origin. Obfuscation of methodology can make ugly
results appear beautiful. With methodology, if it looks beautiful, it is
beautiful. The beauty of methodology is <em>revealed</em> by openness.</p>
<p>Most scientific results have warts. Evidence is halting, uncertain,
incomplete, confusing, and messy. It is that way because scientists are
working on hard problems. Exposing it will accelerate finding solutions
to clean it up. Instead of trying to make results look beautiful when
they are not, the inner beauty of science can be made apparent. Whatever
the results, the inner beauty—strong design, brilliant reasoning,
careful analysis—is what counts. With openness, we won’t stop aiming for
A papers. But, when we get them, it will be clear that we earned them.</p>
